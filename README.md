# Book Club


Book Club is an app that uses MySql to store users along with a list of books chosen by each user. The User saves this list to their unique username which is verified using Passport. When the users page loads the books are seperated into two list, a wishlist, and a read list. Books can be moved from the wishlist to the read list using a button generated for each book. Each user's page is dynamically generated using Handlebars for a unique rendering of their chosen booklist. This application is deployed using Heroku.
